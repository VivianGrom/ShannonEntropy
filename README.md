# ShannonEntropy

This repository contains code and examples demonstrating how to apply Shannon Entropy, Moran's I, and Geary's C to analyze Landscape Evolution Model (LEM) outputs.

*Files Overview*

'Comparison.ipynb' – An interactive Jupyter notebook explaining how to use these spatial metrics.

'class.py' – A Python class containing all necessary functions for metric calculations.

'exp1.py' – A case study analyzing steady uplift.

'exp2.py' – A case study exploring periodic alternating uplift.

'exp3.py' – A case study investigating spatially variable uplift.

'shannon_edem.py' – An example demonstrating entropy calculations using alternative data grids.

'shannon_entropy.py' – A collection of entropy calculation functions, later integrated into a class.

This repository provides a structured approach to quantifying spatial patterns and variability within LEM outputs, facilitating comparative analysis across different uplift scenarios.
